Ever wanted to reward your players joining events or other activities but dont know what to give them ?
Let them choose by thereself by setting up a Event Shop or customize it to you'r own idea.

With this script you are able to reward players with "Event Coins" or whatever you set up in the config.

Simply use /addeventcoins [playerid] [amount]
to give a player the coins they can spend.
The command is restricted to the ace group admin but you can change it in the config.lua.

You can configure the pay method for the script in the config such as paying with eventcoins/item/currency.

Players can check how much eventcoins they have with the command /eventcoins or see it in the ui top right corner.

You can either set up locations with Ped/Marker/Blip/Drawtext or enable to use the /eventshop command.
You can configure everything in the config.lua such as enabling/disabling the command or ped/marker/blip/drawtext.
